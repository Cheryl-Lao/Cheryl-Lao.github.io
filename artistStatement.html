<p>The focal point of the scene moves back and forth on a loop between the two figures to represent how the focus is on everybody to do their part during the COVID-19 crisis. The change in focus is very subtle so it creates a mildly unsettling effect. This makes the viewer question whether their recent increase in screen time during this social distancing period has had detrimental effects on their vision. The "2m" in the center of the scene is a reference to the 2 metre physical separation guideline outlined by the Canadian government. The figures are low-poly to make them relatable to everybody, but the Convocation Hall background is a special nod to the Class of 2020 who are stuck at home instead of graduating in-person this summer.</p>
